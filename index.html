            <p2>Mindscapes is developed by Charlotte Qin, a mixed background designer who had worked through her own mental barriers and resistence to bring the project to light. <br> <br> 
            During the early development of the project, she had received tremendeous encouragement from Jerome Michtell who was then a MA Painting student at the Royal College of Art. Jerome has taken the technique of Mindscapes to develop a workshop to a community of youth who were considered to be at rist, i.e. ready to join a gang, or have living in hostels or other forms of care. Through two sessions of workshop, it was clearly demonstrated that the process had helped the participants to see their goals in life and makes them believe in their abilities of creating a business that positively impcts the community. <br> <br>
            Charlotte had also received tremendeous help from her friends who are software engineers, data visualization, and interaction designers.

                <p> 
                Humans, being part of the universe, are limited by time and space, and the experience of self: our internal thoughts and emotions. This kind of delusion of consciousness is called mental models, our internal representations of the external reality. <br/> <br/>

                Mindscape is the landscape of the mind, a specialized visualization of our thinking which clarifies and contextualizes our mental models. Mindscaper explores the improvable field of our mental models by bridging the subconscious mind to our conscious thinking. It offers a tangible way of rewiring our mental models through a combination of self-inquiry and collective data visualization. <br/> <br/>
                    
                Mindscaper embodies a new branch of citizen science in human consciousness and complexity science. It aims to facilitate personal paradigm shift which would amplify bigger social changes.

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Thank you for your participation in our experiment. You are about to start your first mindscaping journey. In the following short tutorial, we will guide you through the steps to create your own “mindscape”. The minscaping process might be a new experience for you and we would like to ask you for your full attention for the next 10 - 20 minutes while completing the exercise. When you are ready, click the “next” button.</p>

                <tutorial-content2 id = tut2> 
                    <h3>1. Stream of Consciousness</h3>
                    <p>If we think about how we think… our brain rarely seems to stop generating thoughts or processing information. When you think about some aspect of an issue, naturally your thinking flows from one thought to another. As an example, when I think about happiness, I think about love. Naturally, love reminds me of my family, and then I think about home and the favourite dish my mom made… this continuous, uninterrupted flow of thoughts is called the “stream of consciousness”.  <br/> <br/> As the first step of Mindscaping, you will be asked to generate the “stream of consciousness” around a question.</p>

                <tutorial-content3 id = tut3> 
                    <h3>2. Flow of Attention</h3>
                    <p>Flow is the motion of thinking. Like water flows continuously downhill due to gravity, our thinking is driven by the focus of attention. <br/> <br/> 
                    The second step of Mindscaping is to revisit where your attention has been and map out the trajectory of the flow. Starting from any thought on your screen, connect it with what it naturally relates or flows to. Continue doing so until you are informed “a loop has formed”, and then you will be asked to start again on a new thought you haven’t visited. You might find some of the thoughts stand out and get stuck on where to go next – try to focus on the individual thought in this case. Repeat the process until there is no unvisited thoughts left behind, or every circle has one (and only one) outgoing connection.</p>

                <h3>3. Analysis</h3>
                <p>Perceptions are stabilized patterns merged in our thoughts. Often times they are formed in the subconscious mind, which means we are unaware of their existence until they intervene in our consciousness or even actions. Our mental models are constructed this way.

                At the end of your mindscaping exercise, you will receive an analysis of your graph based on your performance. This generally consists of the identification your perceptions, values, and where to intervene in your mental models.</p>

            <p> The name tells it all. The mindscape is the landscape our mind. It is the specialized visualization of our thoughts, which clarifies and contextualizes our mental models. <br/>
            Mental models are our internal representations of the external reality which are useful but limited; though they are improvable. Mindscaper is the miniscule of paradigm shift at the individual level, which embodies understanding, intervening, and upgrading of one's own mental models through a combination of self-inquery and collective process. A constellation of collective mental models, shared values and ideas in the mind of society, constitutes the paradigm: the deepest set of beliefs about how the world works. These beliefs are unstated, unquestioned because everyone knows it but are unaware of themselves knowing it. </p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The global ecological crisis unfolding our time today is ultimately a crisis of anthropocentric perception. In meeting the ecological challenges, the dominator worldview of “men over nature” continues to give rise to more materialistic practice in the name of “sustainability”. This is illogical for me to see what plagues our ecosystem can become the solutions to the problems itself has caused. <br/> To bridge the anthropocentric rift between human and nature, I started to look for design solutions that will make us think and question the world fundamentally from a new perspective so as to release us from the values and procedures that presume everything that exists is an expression of the human.</p>                

            <h3>Mindscaping </h3>
            <p>Mindscaper exists at the intersection of knowledge creation and perception formation. Mindscaper empowers the practitioners through the practice of self-inquiry and demonstrates the formation and leverage points of our perceptions through the <i>mindscape</i>, the visualization of our mental models. <br/>
            Self-regulating nature of thinking to bridge our conscious thinking with the subconscious mind. </p>

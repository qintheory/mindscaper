                <h3> Thanks for your participation in our research about knowledge creation and paradigms</h3>
                <p> We have developed Mindscaper, a reflexive thinking tool which is designed to clarify mental models (our thought processes about how the world works) and contexturalize the formation of subconscious perceptions. You are invited to test out the first demo of Mindscaper and leave some constructive feedback.</p>

            <introduction id = page2>
                <p>First of all, we would like to inform you up front that this thinking exercise might come across a little unusual. In fact, the tasks you will be taught here is not what we are used to do on a regular basis. But don't worry about it. In the next step, we will be demonstrating the techniques through a step-by-step tutorial. When you are ready, click the "next" button. </p>

            <waterlogic id = page3>
                <p>The following practice is an application of  <b>Water Logic</b>, a dimension of thinking identified by Edward de Bono (psychologist and philosopher) in the 1990s. Water Logic clarifies the “flow” of our thinking processes from one thought to another, contineously...</p>
            </waterlogic>
            <example-1 id = page4>
                <p>For example, when I think about <i>happiness</i>… I think about <i>love</i>. Naturally, <i>love</i> reminds me of my <i>family</i>, and then I think about <i>home</i> and <i>Chinese food</i>...</p>
                 <p>As our thinking goes on and on, it might go back to where we have already been, and form a loop </p>

                <p>To sum up, this experience is entirely personal and reflexive. Everybody thinks differently, therefore generates unique thought patterns. Your graph captures the moment of thought processes unique to you, your mind, at this point in your life. </p>

                <p> Think deeply and seriously. Write down anything  comes up to your mind with honesty (can be personal, philosophical, or emotional... the freedom is yours) and click the "submit" button or "enter" key to see the thought pops to the screen. Press "finish" when you feel like you are done and then press "next". </p>

                <p>Imagine your thinking is the river that flows in one direction... Choose one thought to start with, connect it to the next, to which it naturally <i>flows</i> or relates. Repeat this to let the river flow to the next thought, and the next thought until the river forms a loop. Then, we will start a <i>new river</i> and do this again.  </p>

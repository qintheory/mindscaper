                    <h3 class = "problem">In the modern culture, we are encouraged to pursuit happiness. Often time, we subconciously choose to ignore our negative emotions by seeking an escape, such as grabbing a drink. But escaping from the problem does not solve the problem, as the same emotions will come back to you in various forms. We want to confront to our negative emotions and understand the message behind.</h3>
                    <h3 class = "solution">Mindscapes translates moments of consciouness to schematics of perceptions which shows which thoughts are dominant that causes the emotions, which thought leads to cyclial perception, where we can intervene.</h3>

                    <h3 class = "problem">If we think about how we think… our brain rarely seems to stop generating thoughts or processing information. When you think about some aspect of an issue, naturally your thinking flows from one thought to another. As an example, when I think about happiness, I think about love. Naturally, love reminds me of my family, and then I think about home and the favourite dish my mom made… this continuous, uninterrupted flow of thoughts is called the “stream of consciousness”. </h3>

                    <h3 class = "solution">Flow is the motion of thinking. Like water flows continuously downhill due to gravity, our thinking is driven by the focus of attention. </h3>
                    <h3 class = "problem">The second step of Mindscaping is to revisit where your attention has been and map out the trajectory of the flow. Starting from any thought on your screen, connect it with what it naturally relates or flows to. Continue doing so until you are informed “a loop has formed”, and then you will be asked to start again on a new thought you haven’t visited. You might find some of the thoughts stand out and get stuck on where to go next – try to focus on the individual thought in this case. Repeat the process until there is no unvisited thoughts left behind, or every circle has one (and only one) outgoing connection.</h3>

            <h3>Mindscapes is developed by Charlotte Qin, a mixed background designer who had worked through her own mental barriers and resistence to bring the project to light. <br> <br> 
            During the early development of the project, she had received tremendeous encouragement from Jerome Michtell who was then a MA Painting student at the Royal College of Art. Jerome has taken the technique of Mindscapes to develop a workshop to a community of youth who were considered to be at rist, i.e. ready to join a gang, or have living in hostels or other forms of care. Through two sessions of workshop, it was clearly demonstrated that the process had helped the participants to see their goals in life and makes them believe in their abilities of creating a business that positively impcts the community. <br> <br>
            Charlotte had also received tremendeous help from her friends who are software engineers, data visualization, and interaction designers: Bjorn Sommer, Bon Adriel, Lauren Reichl<br> <br>
            Last but not least, her mentors and advisors: Ioana Goga, Julia Griffith
